# Params

In the distributed environment of TMT observatory, **Components** communicate with each other 
by sending asynchronous **Messages**. These messages have a **Command** payload, which flows down 
through the Sequencer components to the Assemblies, HCDs and finally to the hardware. 
At each hop Commands are validated, interpreted and further propagated making their journey to its 
destination. Commands provide flexible placeholders to store values to convey precise intent of the sender component.

`csw-params` is available for Scala and [scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/).
