# Deploying Components

## ContainerCmd

`ContainerCmd` is a helper utility provided as a part of framework. This helps component writers to start their components inside container.

A main application needs to be created which uses framework provided utility `csw.framework.deploy.containercmd.ContainerCmd` 
to start a container or standalone component. The utility supports following parameters which can be provided as arguments to the
application :

* fully qualified path of the configuration file
* **local** if the above path is a path to a file available on local disk. If this argument is not provided the file will be looked
up in the `configuration service` using the same path.
* **standalone** if the configuration file describes a component to be run in standalone mode. If this argument is not provided the 
application expects a configuration file describing a container component and will use it to start a container with all the
components as described in the file.

It is not necessary to have name of the application as ContainerCmdApp/JContainerCmdApp, user can choose any name.

## Container for deployment

A container is a component which starts one or more Components and keeps track of the components within a single JVM process. When started, the container also registers itself with the Location Service.
The components to be hosted by the container is defined using a `ContainerInfo` model which has a set of ComponentInfo objects. It is usually described as a configuration file but can also be created programmatically.

SampleContainerInfo

    ```
    name = "Sample_Container"
    components: [
      {
        name = "SampleAssembly"
        componentType = assembly
        handlersClassName = package.component.SampleAssemblyHandlers
        prefix = abc.sample.prefix
        locationServiceUsage = RegisterAndTrackServices
        connections = [
          {
            name: Sample_Hcd_1
            componentType: hcd
            connectionType: akka
          },
          {
            name: Sample_Hcd_2
            componentType: hcd
            connectionType: akka
          },
          {
            name: Sample_Hcd_3
            componentType: hcd
            connectionType: akka
          }
        ]
      },

        name = "Sample_Hcd_1"

## Standalone components

A component can be run alone in a Standalone mode without sharing its jvm space with any other component. 

Sample Info for an assembly
:   @@@vars
    ```
    name = "Monitor_Assembly"
    componentType = assembly
    handlersClassName = csw.common.components.command.MyComponentHandlers
    prefix = tcs.mobie.blue.monitor
    locationServiceUsage = RegisterOnly
    ```
