# Subsystem

TMT Observatory system is composed of many subsystems. The subsystems that are known participants in the TMT Software System are predefined and the list is covered under the `Subsystem` enumeration. 
They are identified using a 3 or 4 letter abbreviation. 

**Susbsystem** values are used to construct **[Prefix](commands.html#Prefix)** and are used in communication vehicles such as Commands, Events and States.

@@@ note

Subsystems are made available via separate files, for consumption in Scala and Java code.

 * Import `csw.messages.params.models.Subsystem` for **Scala** 
 * Import `csw.messages.javadsl.JSubsystem` for **Java**.
